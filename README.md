Sample Ubuntu 16.04 journald logs used for testing.

Journalbeat from `elk-journalbeat` app doesn't manage to read logs from newer Ubuntu versions (e.g. 20.04) so here we preserve a tiny journald log archive generated by 16.04 to be used for making sure that Journalbeat works properly.

To recreate:

```bash
host$ vagrant up
host$ vagrant ssh

guest$ sudo bash
guest# mkdir /var/log/journal/
guest# chown root:systemd-journal /var/log/journal/
guest# service systemd-journald restart
guest# sleep 3
guest# journalctl --header | grep -q 'File Path' || { echo "journalctl doesn't appear to work."; exit 1 }
guest# mkdir -p /vagrant/var/log/journal/
guest# rm -rf /vagrant/var/log/journal/*
guest# cp -R /var/log/journal/* /vagrant/var/log/journal/
guest# mv /vagrant/var/log/journal/$(ls /vagrant/var/log/journal) /vagrant/var/log/journal/$(cat /vagrant/etc/machine-id)
guest# exit
guest$ exit

host$ vagrant destroy -f
```
